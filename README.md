# [Kaggle competition: Mechanism of Action of Drugs](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa/overview)
  ## (Multilabel Classification problem)
This challenge was hosted on Kaggle by The Connectivity Map, 
the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (LISH), 
and the NIH Common Funds Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures 
(LINCS). 

The goal of this competition was to predict the Mechanism of 
Action of drugs based sets of features. These features were its effect of the drug on the cellular viability and 
gene expression. The data was collect by treating cells with different drug at two different doses records the effects at three distinct treatmeent durations.
The information about the drug, and doses of the drug were anonymized.
