# [Kaggle competition: Mechanism of Action of Drugs (Deadline: November, 23rd 2020) ](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa/overview)
  ## (Multilabel Classification problem)
    This challenge was hosted on Kaggle by The Connectivity Map, the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (LISH), and the NIH Common Funds Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS). The goal of this competetion was to predict mechanism of action of drugs based on the effect of the drug on the cellulal viability and gene expression changes. The data was collect by exposing cells at two different concentration of drug for for three distinct duration and then recording the activity of the cell viability features and gene expression changes. The datasets also control training examples where the samplere were exposed with control/vehicle similar features sets were recorded.
