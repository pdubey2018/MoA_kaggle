# [Kaggle competition: Mechanism of Action of Drugs](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa/overview)
  ## (Multilabel Classification problem)
This challenge was hosted on Kaggle by The Connectivity Map, the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (LISH), and the NIH Common Funds Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS). The goal of this competition was to predict the Mechanism of Action of drugs based on its effect of the cellulal viability and gene expression changes. The data was collect by exposing cells with various drug at two different concentration for three distinct duration and then recording the activity of the cell viability features and gene expression changes. The dose and duration of treatment the also the identity individual drugs were anonymized. The datasets also contain training examples where the cells were exposed with control/vehicle chemicals and the similar features sets were recorded.
